CliMAS [https://climas.hpc.jcu.edu.au/] was a suite of tools providing interactive maps and generating regional reports to examine the future of species distributions and biodiversity across Australia.

As of 30 September 2020, the CliMAS suite of tools has been retired at JCU.

CliMAS addressed a general lack of engagement and knowledge transfer between professional researchers and the end-users of research (general public, conservation managers, decision-makers) by delivering summarised mapped biodiversity of almost all Australian mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and freshwater fish and crayfish.  Maps were created to display suitable climate space projections consisting of 18 different Global Climate Models (GCMs) and 2 potential emissions scenarios (RCPs) from 2015 to 2085. Detailed lists of climate space losses and gains for each species were provided and presented such that visual comparisons could be made by loading two maps and switching between them.

This repository contains the R scripts used to produce the species distributions, summarize the results, and create the reports.
